# new-project.sh — Scaffold a brand-new governed project under the
# Universal Agentic Engineering OS.
#
# Creates <PARENT>/<name> with the canonical 16-file scaffold (real seed
# content, no filler essays), seeds the live checkpoint, vendors the OS
# runtime (scripts, native Claude Code hooks and settings, git hooks, the
# Universal Meta-Skill, MCP baseline, lint config), then initializes git
# with a clean first commit. The result is immediately ready for the master
# initial prompt (docs/05-INITIAL-PROMPT.md in the OS repository).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/new-project.sh <PROJECT_NAME> [PARENT_DIR] [-h | --help]
#
#   PROJECT_NAME   lowercase kebab-case identifier.
#   PARENT_DIR     where to create it (default: current directory).
#
# Exit status:
#   0 — scaffolded, vendored, committed
#   1 — refused (bad name, target exists, git unavailable) or commit failed

## Operating Contract

You operate inside the Universal Agentic Engineering OS. Read, in order:
skills/universal-agentic-workflow.md (complete operating manual),
docs/10-CHECKPOINT.md (live state), then this project's docs/.

## Autonomous Session Protocol

Sessions are zero-prompt by contract. On start, read docs/10-CHECKPOINT.md;
if status is ACTIVE, resume the active milestone immediately with strict
TDD — prompting for permission on in-scope work violates this protocol.
If status is BLOCKED, read the recorded DIR, change hypothesis, wait for
Guide approval.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

Specification before code. TDD always (red-green-refactor). Ponytail
minimalism. Three-strike circuit breaker with DIR logging; never a blind
fourth fix. Zero secret leaks (secrets referenced by name only). Context
hygiene. One concern per worktree. No error swallowing. Zero AI
attribution — no attribution trailers or footers anywhere, ever.

## Quality Gates Before Every Push

Lint, full test suite green, build passing, documentation updated in the
same change, CHANGELOG entry added.

status: ACTIVE

updated: ${today}

## Mission In Effect

To be defined in Phase 1 Socratic discovery. First session: paste the master
initial prompt (OS repository, docs/05-INITIAL-PROMPT.md) as your message.

## Milestone DAG

- [ ] M1 — Complete discovery; fill vision, architecture, backlog; Guide sign-off

## Standing Rules

- Keep this file under 50 lines; archive completed milestones to docs/archive/.
- Resume the active milestone immediately each session — strict TDD, no prompts.
- status: BLOCKED means the circuit breaker tripped; read the DIR, await approval.
